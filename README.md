# Flutter Installation Guide for Windows

This document outlines the step-by-step process of installing Flutter on Windows, including issues encountered and their solutions.

## Initial Setup Process

### 1. Flutter SDK Installation
- Downloaded Flutter SDK (version 3.13.9-stable) from Google's storage
- Created proper directory structure at `C:\src\flutter`
- Extracted Flutter SDK to the designated location

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
Initially encountered several issues with PATH configuration:
1. **Issue**: Flutter couldn't find Git in PATH despite Git being installed
2. **Issue**: System32 directory missing from PATH
3. **Issue**: Flutter installation in non-standard location causing path conflicts

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Git Configuration
- Verified Git installation: `git version 2.50.1.windows.1`
- Git location confirmed at: `C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin\git.exe`

#### 2. PATH Variable Fixes
1. Cleaned up existing Flutter paths to prevent conflicts
2. Added correct Flutter binary location: `C:\src\flutter\bin`
3. Ensured System32 directories were properly included:
   - Added `C:\Windows\System32`
   - Added `C:\Windows`
   - Added `C:\Windows\System32\Wbem`

#### 3. Flutter Location Standardization
- Moved Flutter from Downloads folder to `C:\src\flutter`
- Updated PATH variables to reflect new location
- Verified installation with `flutter doctor`

## Current Installation Status

### Working Components âœ…
1. Flutter SDK (Channel stable, 3.13.9)
2. Windows Version verification
3. Chrome (for web development)
4. VS Code integration
5. Device connectivity
6. Network resources

### Pending Setup ðŸ”„
1. Android toolchain
   - Android Studio installation required
   - Android SDK configuration needed

2. Visual Studio setup
   - Current installation incomplete
   - Reinstallation recommended for Windows development

### Additional Configurations Made
- Disabled Flutter analytics and telemetry for privacy
- Command used: `flutter --disable-telemetry`

## Next Steps

To complete the Flutter development environment setup, the following steps are needed:

1. **Android Development Setup**
   - Install Android Studio
   - Install Android SDK
   - Configure Flutter to use Android SDK
   - Set up Android emulator

2. **Windows Development Setup (Optional)**
   - Reinstall Visual Studio Build Tools
   - Install required Windows development components

## Troubleshooting Tips

If encountering PATH-related issues:
1. Run VS Code as administrator when modifying system PATH
2. Ensure Git is properly installed and accessible
3. Verify System32 directory is in PATH
4. Check Flutter binary location in `C:\src\flutter\bin`
